## ![JST](/assets/img/JST1.jpg) Grant proposal accepted
A (big) grant proposal was accepted! [FOREST (Fusion Oriented REsearch for disruptive Science and Technology) program](https://www.jst.go.jp/souhatsu/en/index.html) of JST. This is a 7.5-year funding that supports "unrestricted, challenging and fusion-oriented diverse research not bound by the existing frameworks". Under this long-term funding, I'll continue studying associations of DOM and microbes in freshwater lakes, focused on Lake Biwa. This is a continued project from Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) that was funded in 2022.

## ![JSPS](/assets/img/JSPS.jpg) Grant proposals accepted
A grant proposal was accepted! [Publicly Offered Research for "Grant-in-Aid for Transformative Research Areas (A)"](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html) of JSPS (2024-2026). I will join a research area called ["Digital biosphere: integrated biospheric science for mitigating global environment change"](https://digital-biosphere.jp/en/about-us). I, as a sole PI, will work on the mechanisms underlying the stabilization of soil organic matter in the chronosequence of planted mangrove forests in Bangkok, Thailand. Studying the evolution of the dissolved organic matter pool in the porewater of the mangrove sediments is also within the scope.  
I also participate in another newly funded program led by [Kazuhide Hayakawa](https://researchmap.jp/read0006894?lang=en) on modeling biodegradation of dissolved organic matter in Lake Biwa using SEC-TOC (2024-2027).

## New instrument
**HPLC-DAD (Hitachi Primade)**  
This instrument will be used for benzene polycarboxylic acid (BPCA) analysis. This series is a basic one but has been known for its durability and stable performance.

## New publication
The first paper from my group is finally out! It's open-access.  
"Functional organic matter components in mangrove soils revealed by density fractionation" published in [***Soil Science and Plant Nutrition***](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00380768.2024.2304761).   
We introduce density fractionation to mangrove soils to identify the distribution and properties of the functional components of SOM regarding degradation state, stability, and origin.

## Award
I received Young Researcher Award (Taguchi Award) from The Japanese Association of Organic Geochemists for my research on Factors Influencing the Molecular Composition and Diversity of Dissolved Organic Matter in Aquatic Environments.

_16 June 2023_
## ![KobeU](/assets/img/KobeU1.jpg) Award
I received [Outstanding Young Researcher Award](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/NEWS/info/2023_06_16_01.html) from Kobe University.

_24 March 2023_
## New publication
The second paper from my postdoctoral work is finally out! It's open-access.  
"Determinants of Microbial-Derived Dissolved Organic Matter Diversity in Antarctic Lakes" published in [***Environmental Science & Technology***](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.3c00249).   
We revealed that the molecular diversity of DOM was driven by environmental dissimilarity rather than the spatial distance, contrary to the distance-decay of similarity usually observed in community ecology.

## ![KobeU](/assets/img/KobeU1.jpg) Funding
I received a four-year grant from [Kobe University Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.research.kobe-u.ac.jp/gksh-web/iar/) which financially supports Early Career tenure-track faculties of Kobe University.

## New instrument
**CHNS(O) Elemental analyzer (Elementar Vario EL Cube)**  
This instrument will be used for general soil elemental analysis. The vario EL cube is designed for simultaneous C, H, N, and S analysis, and an additional option for the determination of O. We are happy to have introduced this German-made instrument with a low-maintenance design but with high performance and versatility.

## ![KobeU](/assets/img/KobeU1.jpg) New members
Misato Hashi, Miho Yamashita, Yuta Watanabe, and Ryu Sumioka as B3 students joined our group!
They will learn lab research themes and experiments from graduate students in the lab until next March.
From next April, they will work on their own undergrad research themes for one year.  
Yes, in Kobe U and in most Japanese universities, students spend 1-1.5 yrs as undergrads and 2 yrs as master's students in the lab, thus they'll have longer experiences before starting the doctoral course compared to most European universities.

_11 October 2022_
## New instrument
**Freeze dryer (Taitec VD-550R)**  
This instrument will be used for sample preparation for a BPCA analysis. It was chosen due to its (relatively) strong durability against acid.

## ![Nissei](/assets/img/hd_logo01.jpg) Grant proposal accepted
A grant proposal was accepted! This is a one-year grant for young researchers working on environmental science by Nippon Life Insurance Foundation. I'll work on SOC stabilization mechanisms in mangrove soils on Ishigaki Island.

_25 May 2022_
## New instrument
**Muffle furnace (YAMATO FO310)**  
The old muffle furnace was replaced with an almost brand-new furnace, thanks to a kind present from a colleague! The overall size is much smaller but equipped with a larger inner capacity. Yeah!

## The dawn of the Kida group in the Soil Science Laboratory
![dawn](/assets/img/DSCF6406_350.jpg)  
On 1 Feb 2021, I started a new position at Graduate School of Agricultural Science of Kobe University in Japan as a tenure-track assistant professor of soil science laboratory!
Before coming here, I spent two fruitful years at Thorsten Dittmar's [ICBM-MPI Bridging Group for Marine Geochemistry](https://uol.de/en/icbm/marine-geochemistry), University of Oldenburg in Germany, with excellent folks.  
Future updates will be posted on this page.
