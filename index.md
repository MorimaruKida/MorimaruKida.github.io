## Grant proposal accepted
A grant proposal was accepted! ["Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B)"](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html) of JSPS. I, as a sole PI, will work on the mechanisms underlying persistence of dissolved organic matter in Lake Biwa, the largest lake in Japan, together with [Yasuhiko Yamaguchi](https://sites.google.com/view/y-t-yamaguchi/home-english/about-me?authuser=0) (Organic Geochemist) and [Yusuke Okazaki](https://yusukeokazaki.weebly.com/profile-english.html) (Microbiologist) for the fiscal years 2022-2025.  
I also participate in another newly-funded program led by [Yasuro Fuse](https://www.hyokadb.jim.kit.ac.jp/profile/en.c532efa723328619125d40601d18f522.html) on the influence of anoxia on the elution of disolved organic matter from Lake Biwa sediment (2022-2025).  
FT-ICR-MS and NMR will be major instruments used in these projects.

## Grant proposal accepted
A grant proposal was accepted! ["Fund for the Promotion of Joint International Research (B)"](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-grants/grants01.html) of JSPS. I join as an early career researcher who plays a core role in this type of funding. As a team, we will study a chronosequence of planted mangrove forests in Bangkok, Thailand for the next five years, in collaboration with Thai researchers, among them is [Sasitorn Poungparn](http://www.botany.sc.chula.ac.th/?p=973) from Chulalongkorn University.

## New project
I joined a JST/JICA-funded [**Blue CARES**](https://www.jst.go.jp/global/english/kadai/h2802_pilipinas.html) project as a member of Geochemistry group to help analyze molecular composition of sedimentary organic matter of mangroves in the Philippines. Collaboration with Toshihiro Miyajima and Raghab Ray from [Marine Biogeochemistry Group](http://bg.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), AORI, the University of Tokyo.

## New members
Ayuri Ohira, Maho Oshimoda, and Kota Hamada as B4 students joined our group!
They will study soil organic matter in diverse Japanese soils and mangrove forests.
Maho will work on FT-ICR-MS in collaboration with Institute for Chemical Research at Kyoto University.

## The dawn of the Kida group in the Soil Science Laboratory
![dawn](/assets/img/DSCF6406_350.jpg)  
On 1 Feb 2021, I started a new position at the Department of Applied Biology of Kobe University in Japan as a tenure-track assistant professor of soil science laboratory!
Before coming here, I spent two fruitful years at Thorsten Dittmar's [ICBM-MPI Bridging Group for Marine Geochemistry](https://uol.de/en/icbm/marine-geochemistry), University of Oldenburg in Germany, with excellent folks.  
Future updates will be posted on this page.
