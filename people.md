Morimaru Kida is an assistant professor of the Graduate School of Agricultural Science of Kobe University where he co-organizes the Soil Science Laboratory. Morimaru expertises in the analysis of natural organic matter.
While centered on Organic Geochemistry and Soil Science, he is keen to apply a range of analytical tools burrowed from different fields such as limnology, marine geochemistry, and statistical computing.
He is currently working on the polar regions (Antarctic lakes and streams, Arctic wetlands), Asian mangroves, and soil archive samples from all over Japan.
