## Graduate students
Graduate students (Master and PhD) can be admitted through MA and PhD programs of the Graduate School of Agricultural Science. Application guidelines can be found [here](http://www.ans.kobe-u.ac.jp/english/nougakubu/admin.html).  
There are a number of governmental and private scholarships available.
[This](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/_mt/2021/04/Scholarship%20for%20international%20students%20EN.pdf) is a comprehensive summary of scholarship for international students (incl. master and Ph.D.) in Japan for the fiscal year 2021-2022. You may also want to see [this](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/study_in_kobe/scholarships/index.html) summary of scholarship by Kobe University.
Please note, however, that most of the scholarships are available _**only after**_ coming to Japan. In addition, to issue visa, you're required to prove that you secure enough monthly income for the entire duration of your stay. This corresponds to at least 120k yen per month including housing.
PhD students from Europe, North America, or India can apply to [Summer Program, Strategic Program, or Short-term program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/index.html) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to conduct joint research activities at our laboratory.

## Postdoctoral fellows
Our team is always welcoming talented, young researchers from the world!   

Prospective Postdoctoral fellows are highly encouraged to apply to funding programs.
The most common and popular Japanese governmental fellowship is [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/index.html).  
Among several programs within this fellowship, [Standard Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-ippan/index.html) is the best for postdoctoral researchers (duration: 12 to 24 months), while other shorter-term programs are also available to those from  the US, Canada, and European countries. Researchers from the US, Switzerland, and India can additionally apply to [Strategic Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow-sp/index.html) in cooperation with the respective Nominating Authority (NSF, ETH Zurich, and DST).

Interested applicants should contact Dr. Morimaru Kida for more information (click the icons below).
