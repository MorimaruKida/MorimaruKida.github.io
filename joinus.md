## Graduate students
Graduate students (Master and PhD) can be admitted through MA and PhD programs of the Graduate School of Agricultural Science. Application guidelines can be found [here](http://www.ans.kobe-u.ac.jp/english/nougakubu/admin.html).  
There are a number of governmental and private scholarships available.
This [pdf](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/_mt/2022/04/3500fb71fcef9dde65fe53c1baa1befd4743b371.pdf) is a comprehensive summary of scholarship for international students (incl. master and Ph.D.) in Japan for the fiscal year 2022-2023. You may also want to see [this](https://www.kobe-u.ac.jp/en/study_in_kobe/scholarships/index.html) summary of scholarship by Kobe University.
Please note, however, that most of the scholarships are available _**only after**_ coming to Japan. [MEXT Scholarship](https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/en/smap-stopj-applications-research.html) is one of few exceptions, but very competitive and requires lots of documents preparation. In addition, to issue visa, you're required to prove that you secure enough monthly income for the entire duration of your stay. This corresponds to at least 120k yen per month including housing.
PhD students from Europe, North America, or India can apply to [Summer Program, Strategic Program, or Short-term Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/index.html) of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) to conduct joint research activities at our laboratory.

## Postdoctoral fellows
Our team is always welcoming talented, young researchers from the world!   

Prospective Postdoctoral fellows are highly encouraged to apply to funding programs.
The most common and popular Japanese governmental fellowship is [JSPS Postdoctoral Fellowships for Research in Japan](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow/index.html).  
Among several programs within this fellowship, [Standard Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-ippan/index.html) is the best for postdoctoral researchers (duration: 12 to 24 months), while other shorter-term programs are also available to those from  the US, Canada, and European countries. Researchers from some countries (currently only Switzerland) can additionally apply to [Strategic Program](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-fellow-sp/index.html) in cooperation with the respective Nominating Authority. The application deadline is usually August or April every year and you'd get the result in about four months. Please note that, candidates must have obtained their doctoral degree within ***six*** years of the date the fellowship goes into effect.    

## Senior researchers
If you obtained your Ph.D. degree more than six years ago, there is still a program that enables you to visit our lab with funding. [Invitational Fellowships for Research in Japan](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-inv/index.html) is just that. This JSPS program provides overseas researchers with an opportunity to conduct collaborative research for a duration of 2-10 months (for long-term) or 14-60 days (for short-term). The applicaiton deadline is usually August for the long-term stay and August or April for the short-term stay, and you'd get the result in about four months. 

Interested applicants should contact Dr. Morimaru Kida for more information (click the icons below).
